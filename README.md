Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) involves progressive cellular accumulation leading to obstructive remodeling of the pulmonary microvasculature. To understand this processthe underlying mechanisms, we analyzed parenchymal samples from 7 idiopathic PAH patients and 7 controls usingconducted single-nucleus (snRNAseq) and spatial transcriptomics (MERFISH) analyses on parenchymal samples from 7 idiopathic PAH patients and 7 controls. Our snRNA-Seq dataset, comprising 72,257 cells, reveals 39 distinct cell types, cross-referenced with the human lung cell atlas v.1. These analyses identify a reduction in microvascular endothelial cells and specific subtypes of monocytes/macrophages infiltrating airspaces, characteristic of late-stage PAH. MERFISH experiments confirm the loss of capillaries in PAH, along with significant alterations in BMP/TGF and endothelin signaling, as well as cellular glutamine synthesis. Moreover, we observed compelling evidence of macrophage adhesion, aggregation, and activation, which coincided with remodeling of the distal pulmonary vessels, providing support for these findings.
